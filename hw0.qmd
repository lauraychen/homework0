## Solving the equation
```{r}
a <- 1 
b <- 3 
c <- 2
det <- b^2 - 4*a*c

# considering 3 cases: 2 roots, 1 root, and no roots
if (det > 0) {
  solution_1 <- (-b + sqrt(det))/(2*a)
  solution_2 <- (-b - sqrt(det))/(2*a)
  cat("There are two real number solutions, which are ", solution_1 ,"and", solution_2,".")
}

if (det < 0) {
  solution_1 <- NA
  solution_2 <- NA
  cat("There are no real number solutions to this equation.")

}
if (det == 0) {
  solution_1 <- (-b + sqrt(det))/(2*a)
  solution_2 <- NA 
  cat("There is one real number solution, which is ", solution_1)

}
```

## Plotting the quadratic equation 

Here, we plot the equation $$f(x)=ax^2 + bx+c=0$$ with the given values of a, b, and c to visually confirm the above solutions.
```{r}
x <- seq(-5, 5, 0.1)
plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
```
